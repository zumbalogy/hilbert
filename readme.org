# Hilbert

Image experiments with hilbert curves and strange attractors, in Clojure with Fortran interop.

This is the spiritual successor to https://github.com/zumbalogy/attract.

The code is dirty and prone to changing.

* Example Output

  Attractor with somewhere between 10-50 million dots per frame:

  Moving colors along a Hilbert curve though RGB color-space:

  Moving colors along a Hilbert curve though RGB color-space (with "glitches"):
